# BluPhone safety features

## Usage tool

A completely optional timer to remind users to take off their headphones every once in a while to help prevent impressions being left on the head, and/or ear infections/sores.

**Default timer:** `40 minutes (headphones on)` `20-60 minutes (headphones off)`

**Minimum:** `30 seconds (headphones on)` `1 second (headphones off)`

**Maximum:** `262,144 seconds (4,369 minutes, or 72.81 hours) (headphones on)` `262,144 seconds (4,369 minutes, or 72.81 hours) (headphones off)`

**Alternative:** `Disable feature, no time limitations`

### Enforcement options:

Only 1 can be active at a time. These should be radio buttons, but due to limitations with Markdown, they are checkboxes. This will be fixed in the actual program.

- [ ] Start beeping/making sound after timer ends (custom sound, default sound, etc.)
- [ ] Temporarily disable headphones after timer ends
