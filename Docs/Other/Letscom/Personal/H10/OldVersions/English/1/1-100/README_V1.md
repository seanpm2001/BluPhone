**Prices as of Friday, June 4th 2021.**

I don't know what happened, if Amazon removed tracking from their links, or if one of my extensions did/getting the result from DuckDuckGo did.

This is an advertisement, I am not affiliated with Letscom, but I highly recommend their usage.

## Pros:

Here are the pros, based on the product, and my experience

1. Hi-Fi (High Fidelity audio)

2. 100 hour battery (for my own usage, I only have to charge them once a month)

3. They contain a built-in microphone

4. Only $20.00, cheaper and more functional than a $100 to $300 pair from Bose or Dr. Dre

5. Headphones are highly durable and flexible, just don't sit on them (they will break, they aren't a Nokia 3310)

6. Headphones are Bluetooth

7. Headphones meet all my needs

8. Linux support (tested as of Ubuntu 20.04)

9. Android support (tested as of Android 10.0 to Android 11.0)

10. MacOS/iOS/iPadOS support (possibly)

11. Windows 10 support (possibly)

12. BSD support (possibly)

## Cons

Here are the cons, none of them apply to me, but may apply to you

1. They are not earphones

2. If you are using Linux, overamplification doesn't work well (it doesn't work well in general yet, even without headphones) and you may hear a lot of statistics

3. [Bug] audio is delayed by 1-3 seconds in playback on Android (Android 10.0, Android 11.0)

4. [Bug] system sounds will interrupt audio at times, and will make the volume controller popup (Android 10.0, Android 11.0)

5. No active noise canceling (Personally, I don't need both at the moment)
