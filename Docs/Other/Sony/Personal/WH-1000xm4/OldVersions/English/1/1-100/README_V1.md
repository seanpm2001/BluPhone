## Sony WH-1000xm4

I recently got a pair of Sony WH-1000xm4 headphones on August 7th 2021, they are the most expensive headphones I own. I didn't open them until August 8th 2021, as I didn't feel like starting to use them yet, due to the timing of things, I don't regret starting a day later.

My original first concern for this pair of headphones was the built-in support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, 2 things I really didn't want, and 2 things that were originally strong enough to make me return the headphones, even if they worked decently. (In case anyone doesn't know, the headphones can't install programs by themselves, you have to do that manually if you really want to. I didn't want to have a problem with these attempting to connect to a device)

The headphones worked much better than expected, and the noise canceling solved a 2+ year growing issue with noise in the house. They worked really well, and were so good, that I experienced Euphoria for over 2 hours straight due to the experience I got from them. The high fidelity audio, the calming ocean sound it plays at all times, and all the great experiences I am going to have with them unlocked a euphoria deposit in my brain.

These headphones have Linux support, and the only problem I currently have is that they are a bit tedious to pair (You have to hold the power button down for 7 seconds for them to enter pairing mode) although they don't have the bug my previous headphones have, where after I pair them, I have to flip the headphones Bluetooth toggle 4 to 13 times to get them to connect properly. Another con is that they have a 30 hour battery compared to a 100 hour battery, but this isn't much of an issue.

If you want to get a pair yourself, they are pretty expensive, so it might take a while for the price to become affordable to most (they currently cost nearly $300.00, as of August 9th 2021 (they currently cost $288.00))

If you can't afford them, you can try out the Letscom H10 headphones, which have lower quality audio and no noice canceling.
