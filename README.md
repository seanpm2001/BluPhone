as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BluPhone/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

The BluPhone project was started on GitHub on Thursday, October 29th 2020 at 5:08 pm.

### Alpha history

The BluPhone project received a lot of work, the first 3 platforms supported include Linux, MacOS, and Windows NT. On this day, the foundation for the project was just starting to get lied down, but no more was done today.

The next day (Friday, October 30th 2020) the project received extensive work, and support for MacOS, Linux and Windows was greatly improved. The projects documentation increased significantly, and the project became functional in some areas, but access to a pair of Bluetooth headphones still isn't possible.

On Wednesday, November 4th 2020, the project received a little amount of work, and experience notes related to my latest pair of headphones that I liked was added. An announcement for partner/developer plans was also announced, and a connection script to Bluetooth devices was added.

On Saturday, November 7th 2020, the project received the homepage of its Wiki. 

On Sunday, November 9th 2020, the project had its Wiki significantly updated. The project laid dormant for a long time after this.

On Wednesday, December 30th 2020, the project received its first project language file.

On Tuesday, January 12th 2021, the project was updated with my new anti-DRM protest standards, and a logo to protest DRM was added. The project laid dormant for a long time again after this.

On Thursday, April 29th 2021, the project received a `.github` folder, and support for funding and file archival.

On Friday, June 4th 2021, the project received additional documentation related to Letscom headphones, although very small, and very personal.

On Monday, August 9th 2021, archival support was finalized, and the project began to get modernized over the next 3 days.

On Tuesday, August 10th 2021, the documentation for the project was improved, and YAML was accepted as the 4th project language.

On Wednesday, August 11th 2021, the project received significant documentation. The project got a logo transfer, its main `README.md` was updated, a Snap application was started, and the project received its own website.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
