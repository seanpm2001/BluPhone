# Project name

This project is named BluPhone. This name is an acronym for BLUetooth headPHONE client, although its purpose has been expanded for future non-Bluetooth headphones (any headphones that have a battery) For this project, blue is spelled without an e for uniqueness, and also so the name would fit in an [8:3 file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename).
